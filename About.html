              <h3> I'm continuously advancing my skills and knowledge in the fields. Outside of coding, I like to keep up with the latest games, both contemporary and retro, through my social media channels, and stay up-to-date with the newest technological developments. My strong conviction is that technology has the potential to create a positive impact on our lives.
