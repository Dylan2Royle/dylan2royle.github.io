      <h3>
        Welcome to my website! I'm Dylan Royle, a passionate tech enthusiast and self-taught programmer. I have a
        strong affinity for all things tech, gaming, and coding and continuously strive to upgrade my skills and
        knowledge in these fields.
        <br>
        At the of <span id="Countdown"> </span> years old, I have experience using languages such as HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript, with some Python programming under my belt. Currently, I'm in the process of learning
        microprogramming with ESP32/8266. Additionally, I enjoy exploring the world of 3D printing and incorporating
        Easter eggs into my code. They May be one on this website or in the website code.
        <br>
        <br>
        Aside from coding, I keep up-to-date with the latest games, both modern and retro, through my social media
        channels. I'm also passionate about staying informed about the newest technological developments and strongly
        believe in the positive impact that technology can have on our lives. The rapidly expanding field of A.I. and
        the boom in coding technology only further emphasize the potential for positive growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for taking the time to visit my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoy
        creating it. If you have any questions or would like to contact me, feel free to reach out at
        enquiries@dylanroyle.co.uk.
